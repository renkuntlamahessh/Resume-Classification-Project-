# Resume-Classification
Abstract. With the onset of the epidemic, everything has gone online, and individuals have been compelled
to work from home. There is a need to automate the hiring process in order to enhance efficiency and decrease
manual labour that may be done electronically. If resume categorization were done online, it would
significantly save paperwork and human error. The recruiting process has several steps, but the first is resume
categorization and verification. Automating the first stage would greatly assist the interview process in terms
of speedy applicant selection. Classification of resumes will be performed using Machine Learning
Algorithms such as Nave Bayes, Random Forest, and SVM, which will aid in the extraction of skills and show
diverse capabilities under appropriate job profile classes. While the abilities are being extracted, an
appropriate job profile may be retrieved from the categorised and pre-processed data and shown on the
interviewer's screen. During video interviews, this will aid the interviewer in the selection of candidates.
